                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p>I started learning to code because I wanted to create things that I like for myself and those close to me, but recently as I've been
                    acquiring the knowledge to do so, I've been won over by the commercial side. Now I write problem solving programs using 
                    Java and I'm learning web development through the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some Front-end Frameworks.

                    <h3>Writing</h3>
                    <p>For the longest time, I've loved writing, and that us because I love reading so much. I have always loved to put my
                     thoughts and fantasies in writing. I usually write poems more often that stories because they come to me 
                    whenever I try to do so, stories on the hand visits from time to time eith spectacular ideas only to be lost in
                     a week or two if not properly documented.

                    <h3>Reading</h3>
                    <p>I've always loved reading, just as musch as writing. I can say for a fact that the most of my free time
                        reading books. The bboks i love reading are mythological books, everything that has to do with 
                        mythology i.e Japanese, Norse, Greek and even local ones like the yoruba, fulani and igbo.

                    <h3>Sports</h3>
                    <p>I have always had a knack for sports. Most of the sports I've tried have all come easy to me,
                         but my favorite are football and basketball. These sports have made most of the fun moments in my life.
